        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I love to tinker with new software tools test them building various personal projects. I enjoy keeping up to date on advances in hardware, software, and UI/UX and seeing how they fuel new technologies. My focus is NLP, but I'm intrigued by all domains of machine learning. Besides work, I'm an outdoor enthusiast—I love running, soccer, skiing, hiking, and biking. I'm avid chess player, Feel free to reach out and connect.</p>

            <h3>Executable Network Models of Integrated Multiomics Data</h3>
            <h4><a href="https://github.com/Thakar-Lab/mBONITA" target="_blank">mBONITA: multi-omics Boolean Omics Network Invariant-Time Analysis</a></h4>
            <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Multiomics profiling provides a holistic picture of a condition being
                examined and captures the complexity of signaling events, beginning from the
                original cause (environmental or genetic), to downstream functional changes at
                multiple molecular layers. Pathway enrichment analysis has been used with multiomics
                data sets to characterize signaling mechanisms. However, technical and biological
                variability between these layered data limit an integrative computational analyses.
                We present a Boolean network-based method, multiomics Boolean Omics Network
                Invariant-Time Analysis (mBONITA), to integrate omics data sets that quantify
                multiple molecular layers. mBONITA utilizes prior knowledge networks to perform
                topology-based pathway analysis. In addition, mBONITA identifies genes that are
                consistently modulated across molecular measurements by combining observed
                fold-changes and variance, with a measure of node (i.e., gene or protein) influence
                over signaling, and a measure of the strength of evidence for that gene across data
                sets. We used mBONITA to integrate multiomics data sets from RAMOS B cells treated
                with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A under varying O2 tensions to identify
                pathways involved in hypoxia-mediated chemotaxis. We compare mBONITA’s performance
                with 6 other pathway analysis methods designed for multiomics data and show that
                mBONITA identifies a set of pathways with evidence of modulation across all omics layers.</p>
