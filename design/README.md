# A sentence for a front door, six destinations

The homepage is one sentence in Alex's voice. Its phrases are the menu, and the crystal beside it
is a gem with one facet per destination. Below come six bands, one per destination, each in its
own style and each with one piece that shows something true. One WebGL canvas draws every style's
world, the crystal, the seams where two bands meet and the click-to-expand effects, all from code:
there are no renders, no video and no 3D models. Photographs are real photographs. Without WebGL
(or on a software renderer), the CSS and SVG art stands in.

| # | Destination | Style | Palette | Type | World (scene) | The band's piece |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | About Me | **House** | paper `#F4F2EE`, ink `#141416` | DM Sans | Paper | The role, three threads, three things built, and a strip of the AI Power Map's 224 moments you can read along |
| 02 | Science | **Liquid Cosmos** | deep space `#05060F`, `#ECE9FF`, cyan `#22E6FF`, magenta `#FF3DCB` | Unbounded, JetBrains Mono | A nebula and stars; liquid-chrome drops with thin-film colour; instrument brackets tracking them | TRAPPIST-1 live, with its transit light curve |
| 03 | Racing | **Glacier** | ice `#E8F0F6`, `#0A1E2C`, glacier blue `#1767C2`, mint `#2BD9A8` | DM Sans | Caustic light through ice, contours, snow | The Birkie drawn at race pace while the clock runs to 2:28:49.04 |
| 04 | Outdoors | **Naturalist's Folio** | forest `#0F1913`, parchment `#EEE4CE`, brass `#CDA562` | Cormorant | A copperplate-engraved forest with a lantern | The 48 as an engraved skyline, lit in the order climbed |
| 05 | Photography | **Darkroom** | black `#0B0A09`, print white `#F2EEE6`, safelight `#E5483F` | DM Sans 300, JetBrains Mono | A red safelight, the tray's ripples, dust in the beam | A reel of twelve prints that develop as they reach the middle |
| 06 | Chess | **Ink & Mist** | paper `#F3EEE3`, ink `#1C1A17`, indigo `#2F4A6B` | Shippori Mincho | Ink-wash ridges and mist, with no cultural motifs | The Scotch playing on a brushed board, live ratings |

## The hero

> I'm Alex Crystal, a **generative AI engineer at MITRE**. I **race on skis and on foot**, have stood
> on **all 48 of New Hampshire's 4,000-footers**, **photograph the places I go**, **chase the strange
> corners of science**, and **play the Scotch**.

- **Pointing at a phrase** (hover, focus, or a facet of the crystal) floods the gem with that world from its facet, behind a prismatic front, and swaps the line beneath the sentence for a fact.
- **Clicking a phrase** expands into the page from the crystal.
- **On touch screens:**
  - the first tap shows the world, and the second opens the page;
  - until someone taps, the crystal tours the worlds every 5 s.

## Seams

Nothing is pinned: the page scrolls normally. Where two styles meet, the scene draws a strip of
the screen across the boundary, with the upper world above an edge and the lower one below it. The
edge leans with the boundary's place on screen (`seamAt` in `lerp.js`), so it sweeps as you scroll.

| From → to | Seam |
| --- | --- |
| About Me → Science | The paper ends in a meniscus of liquid chrome; drops fall from it into space |
| Science → Racing | The liquid freezes: a lattice front with a bright, chromatic rim |
| Racing → Outdoors | The ice melts off in drips, uncovering the engraving; each drip catches the lantern |
| Outdoors → Photography | The lantern gutters to a red safelight |
| Photography → Chess | The developer clears into ink wash, dark at its wet edge |

## How it works

- **Homepage.**
  - `static/site/home.js` registers scene hosts:
    - the hero, with the crystal (mode 7);
    - one per band (its world, mode 0);
    - one per seam (mode 6).
  - It also runs:
    - the sentence;
    - the bands' arrivals;
    - each band's piece (`powermap.js`, `race-pace.js`, `skyline.js`, `sims.js`, `previews.js`);
    - the header's ink.
  - Per frame it reads `scrollY` and nothing else from the layout; the layout is measured on resize.
- **Scene.** `static/site/scene/scene.js` owns a fixed canvas behind every page that survives router swaps. The shader is in `static/site/scene/glsl/`:

  | File | What it holds |
  | --- | --- |
  | `house.js` | The crystal and the paper |
  | `ink.js`, `glacier.js`, `cosmos.js`, `folio.js`, `darkroom.js` | The worlds |
  | `seams.js` | The seams |
  | `opens.js` | The expand effects |

  The canvas buffer drops its resolution when frames run long, and the pages fall back to their CSS art when even that is not enough.
- **Expand.** `static/site/expand.js` plugs into the router.
  - The scene draws the cover in front of the page from the clicked element's rectangle.
  - The router swaps the page underneath.
  - The reveal plays behind the new page's hero, whose letters arrive at the same time.
  - Back to the homepage, the page's world fills the screen and folds back into its band.
- **Pages.**
  - Each destination is a package, `<dir>/page/`, holding `meta.json` and `content.html`.
  - `tools/site/build_pages.py` fills the markers in `content.html` from data:

    | Marker | Data |
    | --- | --- |
    | `<!--gen:races-->` | `athletics/page/races.json` |
    | `<!--gen:skyline-->` and `<!--gen:hikes-->` | `outdoors/page/peaks.json` |
    | `<!--gen:powermap-->` | `ai-timeline/timeline-data.json` |
    | `<!--gen:timeline-->` | `about/page/timeline.html` |

  - The registry's `redirects` become small pages that forward old URLs (`/work/` and the old Coding page).
- **Science.** Each experiment is a module in `science/page/sims/`.
  - It exposes `mount(el, { reducedMotion, compact })`.
  - Its pure maths are exported and tested in `tools/site/tests/science.test.mjs`.
  - Every number comes from a source listed on the page.
- **Fallbacks.**
  - With reduced motion (or Motion off):
    - the scene holds still;
    - experiments draw one frame;
    - prints are developed;
    - the 48 are lit.
  - Without JavaScript every page is complete and static.
