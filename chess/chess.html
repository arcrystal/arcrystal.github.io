            <h1>My ELO is 900</h1>
            <p>This page is as much for me as it is for anyone reading this, so I can remember the fundamentals that may or may not get me to 1000.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Develop pieces and castle as soon as possible</li>
                <li>Connect your rooks</li>
                <li>Rooks on the 7th rank are dangerous</li>
                <li>Look for checks, captures, and attacks</li>
                <li>Count attackers and defenders</li>
                <li>Protect your pawns</li>
                <li>Bishop pairs are strong- don't trade them for knights</li>
                <li>Be wary of back-rank checkmates</li>
                <li>When you're up material, play carefully and slowly</li>
                <li>Forks, pins, knifes, and batteries are ways to go up material</li>
            </ol>
